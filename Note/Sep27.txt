File type

Text
    SOme auto formating
    "\n" will be the new line
    can read/write in large formatted chunks

Binary
    all data is in terms of bytes
    some may be readable, may not
    much more efficient for certain type of the data
        images, audio, database

File streams
    access to file data in C++ is thorugh streams
    similat to cin and cout
        global member of classes istream and ostream 
        fila stream are input/output stream specific for file
    #include <fstream>

FILE 
    give access to streams
    more efficient sometimes

    FILE * pfile;
    pFile = fopen("text.txt", "w")
    if(pFile != NULL){
        fputs("fopen example",pFile)
        fclose(pFile)
    }

    int x;
    ifstream infile
    infile.open("text.txt", ios::binary | ios::in)
    infile.read(&x,7)//reads 7 bytes and saves to x

important file operations
    fopen
    freopen
    fclose
    fflush
    fread 
    fwrite

Positioning
    ftel
        returns the current position indicator
    fgetpos
        gets the file position indicator
    fseek
        moves the file position indicator to specific location in a file

    fsetpos
        same as fseek
    rewind
        movesthe file mosition indicator to the beggining of the file
    
SEEK
    SEEK_SET
        seeking from the beggining of the file
    SEEK_CUR
        seeking from the current position
    SEEK_END
        seeking from the end
